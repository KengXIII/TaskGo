# TaskGo

TaskGo is a web-based todo-list to help users keep track of all their tasks and provides notification when incomplete tasks are about to be due.

The website that we designed is mainly for NUS students. As such, features like importing calendars from NUSMods are applicable to undergraduates only.

* Insert single and routine tasks
* Create tags that users can assign tasks to
* Priority and Tag sorting
* Email notification for incomplete tasks that are due soon.

## Comparison with similar platforms
TaskGo is a web-based to-do list that is designed to help our users to keep track of their routine and ad-hoc work in a clear and concise web application. The task can be modified and added according to the user's needs. As such, users would be able to experience flexibility in customising their own schedules. Users are also given a kind reminder via e-mail when their tasks are almost due.
### NUSMods
NUSMods simply provides the users with the general lesson schedule. More can be done on the scheduling side, where students might want to add more personalised tasks onto their schedule.
### LumiNUS
LumiNUS highlights the due dates of important submissions / tests, as entered by NUS Module Coordinators. However, some of these dates are not accurate, and students themselves are unable to make edits and improvements onto such scheduling functionalities.
